# Calc: a terminal calculator

calc was made after I thought that it would be helpful to have a command line editor, especially since I spend a lot of time there already.
This way I wouldn't have to either start a new calculator instance each time I want to calculate something or keep said instance open.

# How do I use it?

To calculate something you pass the equation as a command line parameter in quotation marks as to not confuse the shell. There are also some options but actually useful ones will be added in the future.

Example:
```bash
calc "(189+78)*(9685-8903)"
```
